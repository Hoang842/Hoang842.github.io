### FAVORITE CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, part 2
 
    I think working with dates in code is interesting. Calendars seem simple, but translating them for computers takes work. Programming the Gregorian calendar used today would let me solve some cool problems. I do get to convert dates that people enter into formats computers can use internally. 

* Lab 4, part 2
    
    Creating a guessing game could be an enjoyable coding project. The rules are simple, but the programming presents some interesting challenges. I just need to generate a random number for the player to guess. People like playing games so it would be fun to create something entertaining.

* Lab 5, part 1

    A simple concept can still make good coding practice. Finding the area of rectangles is math people learn early on. Turning that formula into a working program takes real effort though. I do enjoy leveling up my coding abilities on something simple yet useful like rectangle area calculation. Calculating rectangle area seems like a good coding challenge.
